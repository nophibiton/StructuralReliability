# Structural Reliability
This repository contains different structural reliability (SR) analysis methods and examples. The SR analysis methods are implemented through matlab and the corresponding description (or published literature) is provided in the description. Some

**Structural reliability methods:**
1. [Sequential compounding method](https://github.com/nophibiton/StructuralReliability/tree/bb0938c7654242f49f815cec3f694f5aea7fa482/1.%20Sequential%20Compounding%20Method)
2. [System reliability bounds using LP](./2.%20System%20reliability%20bounds%20using%20LP/)
3. [AK-MCS Active Learning reliability method](https://github.com/nophibiton/StructuralReliability/tree/bb0938c7654242f49f815cec3f694f5aea7fa482/3.%20AK-MCS%20Active%20Learning%20reliability%20method)

**Other Application Examples**
1. [[Example] System reliability analysis of bridge network](https://github.com/nophibiton/StructuralReliability/tree/bb0938c7654242f49f815cec3f694f5aea7fa482/4.%20%5BExample%5D%20System%20reliability%20analysis%20of%20bridge%20network)
