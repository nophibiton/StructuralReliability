# AK-MCS Active Learning reliability method using Kriging and MCS

The matlab codes provided here demonstrates on how to perform reliability analysis using AK-MCS.
The matlab codes provided here demonstrates on how to pefrom Sequential Compounding Method (SCM) for calculating system failure probability.

The description of the examples are provided in the paper:
