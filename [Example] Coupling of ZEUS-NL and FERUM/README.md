# Framework for FERUM and ZEUS-NL software

A computational framework that couples the finite elemant analysis software, [ZEUS-NL](https://mae.cee.illinois.edu/software/software_zeusnl.html) and structural reliability analysis package [FERUM](https://github.com/TNO/custom_FERUM?tab=readme-ov-file). A simple frame example is used to demonstrate the analysis framework. Prerequisites are: 1) FERUM is properly set-up in your MATLAB environment and 2) ZEUS-NL should be installed.
