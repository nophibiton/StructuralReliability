# Sequential compounding method

Sequential compounding method is a sturctural system reliability analysis tool. It can be used for series, parallel and general structural systems. The basic idea of the method is to sequentially combine/compound system events until a super *equivalent* event approximates the entirel system. The matlab codes provided here demonstrates on how to pefrom sequential compounding method for calculating system failure probability.

The description of the examples are provided in the paper:
- Kang, W. H., & Song, J. (2010). Evaluation of multivariate normal integrals for general systems by sequential compounding. Structural Safety, 32(1), 35-41.

The results can be verified from the original paper.
